# Vr-FishCream

Hello! In our vr project we decided to make a chaotic comedy game. The game concept is simple. You are a ice cream seller and you hit the kids when the parents look away and in same time where is a pervert that tries to kidnap the kids. 

## Parent and Kids
Before I tell you my area I just want to mention that I wanted to have a challenge for myself, to no use update in the project. I really wanted to learn the event system and coroutines, it was challenging but fun. My area of responsibility was the family system, kids and parent. I wanted to make a object pool for the whole system. Instantiate kids, parent and empty family objects first, then systematicly put the kids and parents under empty family objetcs. 

When the family was ready to go, I made 3 point for them. Point A where they start to go from and move towards point B, which is the kiosk. Because I wanted to create a asyrncous system I used coroutines.Then I move those families to the kiosk staation with coroutines and let the members of the family do their things then leave and go to point C where they resets.
